# 1. Load the two temple images and the points from data/some_corresp.npz

# 2. Run eight_point to compute F

# 3. Load points in image 1 from data/temple_coords.npz

# 4. Run epipolar_correspondences to get points in image 2

# 5. Compute the camera projection matrix P1

# 6. Use camera2 to get 4 camera projection matrices P2

# 7. Run triangulate using the projection matrices

# 8. Figure out the correct P2

# 9. Scatter plot the correct 3D points

# 10. Save the computed extrinsic parameters (R1,R2,t1,t2) to data/extrinsics.npz
